- 👋 Hi, I’m @sebfloapps
- 👀 I’m interested in creating cloud based web and mobile applications.
- 🌱 3 Years ago I started developing mobile apps with Flutter. Coming from 15 years of backend development with PHP and Python it was a big move but a move I am happy I made as I found a whole new love for development with developing for mobile.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything innovative, fun, and/or exciting.
